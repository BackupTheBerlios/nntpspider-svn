	<h3><span>Overview</span></h3>
	<p class="p1"><span>


		<span class="nntpspider">nntpspider</span> searches for
		public accessable NNTP servers. It reads a list of known
		servers from <I>file</I> arguments, or if none are
		specified, its standard input. All the found servers are
		checked for public access, queried for a list of supplied
		newsgroups and for information about additional nntp
		servers. The resulting list of currently availiable
		newsservers is saved to a file <I>serverscan.result</I> in
		the current directory. For every public host the list of
		supplied newsgroups is saved to a file
		<I>&lt;hostname&gt;.grouplist</I>

	</span></p>
	<h3><span>How does it work?</span></h3>
	<p class="p3"><span>

		All servers with public or unknown status are queried for a
		list of supplied newsgroups. If access is granted, the Path:
		lines from the message headers of Usenet postings in a
		couple of groups are scanned for information about the nntp
		servers used posting these ones. All found servers are
		queried until no more unknown servers are found.

	</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span>

		The search starts with at least one default newsserver you
		have access to, usually the one at your ISP. The list of
		known server is read from the given files or read from
		stdin.

	<h3><span>Prerequisitories</span></h3>
	<p class="p1"><span>

		<ul>
			<li>Perl (tested with Perl 5.8.3 but should work with every version)</li>
			<li>Net::NNTP module (avaliable at <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a>)</li>
		</ul>

	<h3><span>Bugs</span></h3>
	<p class="p1"><span>

		Many. It is an early alpha version, far from being bullet
		proof. Expect the worse.

	</span></p>
	<p class="p1"><span>

		Results are saved in file serverscan.result. Much too
		verbose. Sometimes very slow when accessing individual
		articles (looking dead, but still working). Queries the
		standard port 119 only, so &quot;hidden&quot; servers using
		non-standard portnumbers can't be detected. Filename not
		configurable.  Existing files will be overwritten without a
		warning.

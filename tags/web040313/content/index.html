	<h3><span>News</span></h3>
	<p class="p1"><span>

		New release v0.1 is 
		<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1550">
		availiable now</a>. It is a major
		improvement in usability and fixed many bugs from the
		pre-alpha version 0.0.1. Now it reached full alpha status:
		It is usable, but major changes in the commandline and the
		code are very likely.

	</span></p>
	<h3><span>Overview</span></h3>
	<p class="p1"><span>

		<span class="nntpspider">nntpspider</span> searches for
		public accessable NNTP servers. It reads a list of known
		servers. All these servers are checked for public access,
		queried for a list of supplied newsgroups and for
		information about additional nntp servers. These new servers
		are recursivly queried. The resulting list of currently
		availiable newsservers is saved to a file.
		For every
		public host the list of supplied newsgroups is saved to a
		file.

	</span></p>
	<h3><span>How does it work?</span></h3>
	<p class="p3"><span>

		All servers with public or unknown status are queried for a
		list of supplied newsgroups. If access is granted, the Path:
		lines from the message headers of Usenet postings in a
		couple of groups are scanned for information about the nntp
		servers used posting these ones. All found servers are
		queried until no more unknown servers are found.

	</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><span>

		The search starts with at least one default newsserver you
		have access to, usually the one at your ISP. The list of
		known server is read from the given files or read from
		stdin.

	</span></p>

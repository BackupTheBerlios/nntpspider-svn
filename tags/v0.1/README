NNTPspider - Automated search for public accessable nntp servers

Using informations from the message headers this tools searches for freely
accessable nntp servers. This search starts with at least one default newsserver 
you have access to, usually the one at your ISP. It reads the Path: lines in
the headers in order to find more newsservers. All the found servers are
checked for public access and queried for a list of supplied newsgroups
resulting in a quite complete list of all newsservers currently availiable.

NNTPspider queries the standard port 119 only, so "hidden" servers using
non-standard portnumbers can't be detected.

Writing this tool was inspired by the windows based NewsWolf
(http://www.netwu.com/newswolf)



Format of the server list (infile, outfile):
--------------------------------------------

One line per server.
Empty lines allowed.
Leading spaces and tabs are ignored.
Lines starting with # are treated as comments and ignored.
Several fields per line, seperated by ':'

a) outfile:
   name:[port]:[user]:[pass]:[status]:[server response]

b) infile:
   name[:[port][:[user][:[pass][:[status][:[server response]]]]]]

   If more than one one line exists for one particular server, only the first
   is used.
   Only the first five fields (name, port, user, pass and status) are read.
   Only the first field, the server name, is mandatory. If a field is missing
   or is empty, default values are used.

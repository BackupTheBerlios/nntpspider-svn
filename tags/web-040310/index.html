<h2>NNTPspider - Automated search for public accessable nntp servers</h2>

<B>nntpspider</B>
searches for public accessable NNTP servers. It reads a list of known servers
from
<I>file</I>
arguments, or if none are specified, its standard input. All the found
servers are checked for public access, queried for a list of supplied
newsgroups and for information about additional nntp servers. The
resulting list of currently availiable newsservers is saved to a file
<I>serverscan.result</I>
in the current directory. For every public host the list of supplied
newsgroups is saved to a file
<I>&lt;hostname&gt;.grouplist</I>


<H2>How does it work in detail?</H2>

All servers with public or unknown status are queried for a list of supplied
newsgroups. If access is granted, the Path: lines from the message headers
of Usenet postings in a couple of groups are scanned for information about
the nntp servers used posting these ones. All found servers are queried
until no more unknown servers are found.
<P>

The search starts with at least one default
newsserver you have access to, usually the one at your ISP. The list of
known server is read from the given files or read from stdin.


<h2>Prerequisitories</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Perl
		(tested with Perl 5.8.3 but should work with every version)</li>
	<li>Net::NNTP module 
		(avaliable at <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a>)</li>
</ul>


<H2>Bugs</H2>

Many. It is an early alpha version, far from being bullet proof. Expect the
worse. <P>

Results are saved in file serverscan.result. Much too verbose. Sometimes
very slow when accessing individual articles (looking dead, but still
working). Queries the standard port 119 only, so &quot;hidden&quot; servers
using non-standard portnumbers can't be detected. Filename not configurable.
Existing files will be overwritten without a warning. <P>

Please report all bugs to the bug tracker on the project web
site. Just go to <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/nntpspider,">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/nntpspider,</A> and click
&quot;Bug Reports&quot; on the sidebar under &quot;Features.&quot;

My todo-list an a kind of roadmap for this project (Sorry, some parts are
still in german)

- implement a quit mode: Only the resultlines are printed to stdout. (v0.2)

- print all debug messages to stderr, all verbose messages to stdout. (v0.2)

- use XHDR/HDR command if availiable. (v0.2)

- in checkout_groups: check for "480 Username/password required" and correct 
  status to 'c' (v0.2)

- display state of the todo list (not only in debug mode) (v0.2)

- fetch random articles from the configured groups, not only stricly the 
  first #n (but be shure not to fetch the same article twice) (v0.2)

- beachte timestamps und besuchsintervall (v0.2)

- measure connection and server speed (v0.2)

- propagate even empty lines and comments from the in- to outfile. (0.2)

- preserve the full file structure and line order from in- to outfile (v0.2)


Planned features for version 0.3:
=================================

- choose some random newsgroups from a server instead of looking for a few
  fixed ones. Prefer well populated groups (v0.3)

- allow a blacklist for domains not worth testing e.g. typical dial-in domains
  like (v0.3)
	dip.t-dialin.net
	arcor-ip.net
	dip0.t-ipconnect.de
	ipt.aol.com
	reverse.qdsl-home.de
	pppool.de
	pool.mediaways.net
	dipool.highway.telekom.at
	adsl.hansenet.de
	adsl.skynet.be
	vie.telering.at
	dial.de.ignite.net
	dialup.nuria.telefonica-data.net

- collect a worldwide dial-in blacklist (I hope somebody will contribute)
  (v0.3)

- read (and save?) a configfile, e.g. ~/.nntpspider (v0.3)


Planned features for version 0.4:
=================================

- read a list of known public NNTP-servers from a given URL (0.4)

- website: allow (automatic?) upload of resultlists and merge all
  contributions to one usenet-server database. Allow download of the
  resulting super-list.  (v0.4)



Wishlist for later versions:
============================

- find a way to systematicly check for non-standard nntp ports. Don't do
  a complete portscan! Only some typical non-standard ports. E.g. ask google
  to find NNTP-lists automaticly (v1.0)

- Makefile should insert the value for $version variable in nntpspider

- Implement long options

- html-filter für Ergebnissliste

- Dateien nicht kommentarlos überschreiben, sondern durchnummerierte Kopien
  anlegen (wie wget)

- make a debian package

- write a full-blown Makefile (maybe automake?)

- write a GUI (v2.0)

- write a php version for integration in websites (really useful?)



Done:
- reorganize verbosity levels. Now normal and even verbose are too quiet,
  only debug gives you a feeling if it is still working. (v0.2)

- display activity when fetching the articles ("fetching article 12/100", 
  "fetching articles... /", "fetching articles 56%") (v0.2)

- check servermessage for ':' (replace by ';')

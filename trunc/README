NNTPspider - Automated search for public accessable nntp servers

Using informations from the message headers this tools searches for freely
accessable nntp servers. This search starts with at least one default newsserver 
you have access to, usually the one at your ISP. It reads the Path: lines in
the headers in order to find more newsservers. All the found servers are
checked for public access and queried for a list of supplied newsgroups
resulting in a quite complete list of all newsservers currently availiable.

NNTPspider queries the standard port 119 only, so "hidden" servers using
non-standard portnumbers can't be detected.

Writing this tool was inspired by the windows based NewsWolf
